=== THIS IS UNDER MAJOR DEVELOPMENT! ===
This is the v1-dev edition of my some-what known Gox API, except this version
works with the v1 API. I recommend you DISCONTINUE using this version unless
you want problems, instead, I recommend you continue using my v0 API wrapper
from HERE: https://github.com/Someguy123/MtGOX-PHP-API

=== What is this? ===
The MtGOX API is sort-of confusing for some, and can be annoying to work with,
So, I have created a simple class file which makes using the API fairly easy
by creating functions which automatically parse the API into normal PHP arrays
that are easy to implement in your normal PHP scripts.

It's released under the LGPL, which means you CAN use it in a proprietary script
as long as you keep the copyright notice, and let people know that you're using it.
===
Enough with what this is, here's how you use it:

=== HOW TO USE ===
Place GoxPublic.class.php and/or GoxPrivate.class.php in the same directory as your script
Put an "include("GoxPublic.class.php");" at the top of your script, and if you need access
to the private API (Withdrawing, depositing, getting your account information, etc.),
you must include GoxPrivate.class.php directly after GoxPublic.class.php

If you only require the public API (tickers, currency pair info, etc.), you only need to
initialize GoxPublic
"""
$gox = new GoxPublic;
"""

If you need any private API functions such as withdrawing, trading, depositing, and account
information, you must initialize the GoxPrivate class with your API key and secret.
WARNING: You do NOT need to initialize both classes, GoxPrivate includes the public API
functions too, but you MUST include() the GoxPublic class.
"""
$gox = new GoxPrivate('myLongAPIKey', 'Mysecretsecret');
"""

Not much else needs to be explained, I have documented each function with phpDocumentor
comments, so if you use an IDE like phpDesigner, it should explain every function as you
type them. If not, just open up the class in your favourite editor and read through the
comments, they're pretty self explanatory.

=== DEPENDENCIES ===
- PHP 5> (obviously, MAY work with PHP4, no guarantees)
- cURL (and the plugin must be enabled in php.ini)
- PHP JSON plugin ( Included by default in most installs, if you get any json_decode
                    errors, you may need to install or enable the plugin)
