=== What is this? ===
The MtGOX API is sort-of confusing for some, and can be annoying to work with,
So, I have created a simple class file which makes using the API fairly easy
by creating functions which automatically parse the API into normal PHP arrays
that are easy to implement in your normal PHP scripts.

It's released under the LGPL, which means you CAN use it in a proprietary script
as long as you keep the copyright notice, and let people know that you're using it.
===
Enough with what this is, here's how you use it:

=== HOW TO USE ===
Place Gox.class.php in the same directory as your script
Put an "include("Gox.class.php");" at the top of your script
Directly below that, or where it is needed, initialize the class by giving it
your API Key and secret obtained from mtgox.com:
"""
$gox = new Gox('myLongAPIKey', 'Mysecretsecret');
"""
Not much else needs to be explained, I have documented each function with phpDocumentor
comments, so if you use an IDE like phpDesigner, it should explain every function as you
type them. If not, just open up the class in your favourite editor and read through the
comments, they're pretty self explanatory.

=== DEPENDENCIES ===
- PHP 5> (obviously, MAY work with PHP4, no guarantees)
- cURL (and the plugin must be enabled in php.ini)
- json_decode (I think that's native in PHP, not sure so I'll list it here anyway)
